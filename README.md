# HOW TO SETUP A MULTIPLAYER KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM SERVER ON LINUX

If you are here for just the mods, this is the file you need <a href="DarkMultiPlayer.ckan">DarkMultiPlayer.ckan</a>
You are going to need more than 8Gb of RAM to play on our server because KSP has to load all of the parts into memory.

# Server Setup
- The following is how to install the required parts for DarkMultiPlayer and the Mods needed for my server. You only need DarkMultiPlayer to do this without all my mods.
- Port 6702 needs to be forwarded in your router

# Install
```git clone https://github.com/diveyez/KSP_ModdedMultiPlayer/tree/master && cd KSP_ModdedMultiPlayer && sudo bash install
```

You, of course, need to setup the configuration and more information on how to do that can be found here: <a href="http://d-mp.org/w/Main_Page">DMP Wiki</a>

# HOW TO SETUP A MULTIPLAYER KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM SERVER ON LINUX

# Server Setup
- The following is how to install the required parts for DarkMultiPlayer and the Mods needed for my server. You only need DarkMultiPlayer to do this without all my mods.
- Port 6702 needs to be forwarded in your router

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/diveyez/KSP_ModdedMultiPlayer/tree/master && cd KSP_ModdedMultiPlayer && sudo bash install
```

You, of course, need to setup the configuration and more information on how to do that can be found here: <a href="http://d-mp.org/w/Main_Page">DMP Wiki</a>
